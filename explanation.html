<li> <strong>A short explanation of why you choose your chosen technology </strong></li>
<p>Because Python is a powerful and versatile language. It is designed to be simple to read and write. Even though the task can be completed in Bash and other languages but the libraries offered from AWS makes it easier to use, giving more control over the program.</p>

<li> <strong>A short explanation of how you might improve or extend your solution, given more time </strong></li>
<p>The script can be created with more options to users. For example, it can provide with an option to either select an existing key_pair or create a new one. Another option would be to either use an existing instance or creating new instance. The credentials that are being passed in the command line can easily be exported to a file and Python can read from it, making it easier and user friendlier. I can add an option to download the file directly from S3 and upload it to the remote location. If given more time, I can create a Slackbot that will handle the request from the user. The bot will ask user for credentials and the file to upload, it will process the request by creating a new instance and uploading the file to new EC2 instance. </p>
